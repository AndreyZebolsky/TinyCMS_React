# TinyCMS
The smallest CMS engine ever, made with [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore) and [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper). Currently, only static content is supported, but adding new pages is as simple as inserting a new row in a database table with the raw HTML content of the page.
